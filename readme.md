Supported Python version 3.6+

This is an asynchronous parser for Google Trends Realtime Search Trends, and finding coincidences in CNN RSS feeds.

Script has both parser and frontend UI. I used Pypeeter and Feedparser libraries for parser and Aiohttp server for the frontend. 

To get a result from the script you need just run server_client.py to parse and show the data.
After this and you can see UI in your browser visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000 page
